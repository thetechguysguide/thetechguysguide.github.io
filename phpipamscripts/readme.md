# phpIPAM Installation and Maintenance Scripts

This folder contains scripts that automate the installation and setup of the phpIPAM server. phpIPAM is an IP Address Management (IPAM) tool that helps network administrators efficiently manage their IP address space. These installation scripts streamline the deployment process by handling the installation of necessary components, configuring the environment, and securing the setup.

## Features of the Installation Scripts

### 1. Dependency Installation
The scripts ensure that all required software dependencies are installed, including:
- Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
- PHP
- Database services (e.g., MySQL/MariaDB)

By automating these steps, the scripts reduce the need for manual installation of each component.

### 2. Database Setup
The scripts automate the creation of:
- phpIPAM databases and tables
- Database users
- Database permissions

This ensures that phpIPAM can connect to and operate with the database securely and effectively.

### 3. Initial Configuration
The scripts handle key initial configurations, such as:
- API settings for phpIPAM
- Securing the web interface with SSL
- Setting up the admin account

These configurations ensure that the phpIPAM server is ready for use immediately after installation.

### 4. SSL Integration
If required, the scripts manage SSL setup by:
- Generating self-signed SSL certificates
- Configuring certificates from trusted authorities

This ensures the phpIPAM server is secured and accessible via HTTPS, protecting data during transmission.

### 5. File Permissions and Security
The scripts ensure proper file and directory permissions are set for:
- phpIPAM's web interface
- Associated configuration files

This step is crucial for securing sensitive files and reducing unauthorized access risks.

### 6. Configuration Templates
The scripts may utilize templates for phpIPAM configuration files. These templates are:
- Automatically populated with system-specific values (e.g., database credentials, API tokens)
- Ensuring the correct setup for the target environment

### 7. Post-Installation Checks
After installation, the scripts perform checks to verify:
- The web server and database are running correctly
- phpIPAM is operational without errors

These checks help ensure a smooth installation process and catch any issues early on.

## Summary
The installation scripts in this repository simplify and automate the setup of phpIPAM. They ensure that:
- Dependencies are installed
- The database is set up and secured
- SSL is configured (if needed)
- File permissions are correct
- Initial settings for phpIPAM are properly configured

With these scripts, phpIPAM can be deployed quickly and securely, with minimal manual intervention.
